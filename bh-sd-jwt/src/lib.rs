//! This crate implements Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens.
//!
//! It provides functionality to create, sign, and verify JWTs that support selective disclosure of
//! claims, in accordance with emerging IETF drafts: [Selective Disclosure for JWTs (SD-JWT)][1] &
//! [SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC)][2].
//!
//! [1]: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt>
//! [2]: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc>
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! The main components of this crate are the following.
//!
//! * [`issuer`] -- Constructs and signs JWTs with standard and custom claims.
//! * [`holder`] -- Imports, manages, and presents SD-JWT credentials with selective disclosure.
//! * [`verifier`] -- Validates JWT signatures, claim integrity, and key binding challenges.
//! * [`lookup`] -- Provides different methods of retrieving an issuerâ€™s public key.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The `bh-sd-jwt` repository contains [the full examples][examples], so you should take a look
//! there to see how things fit together.
//!
