# bhx5chain

This library provides functionality for working with an ordered array of X.509
certificates as defined in [RFC
9360](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9360.html#section-2-5.4.1) for use in
other The Blockhouse Technology Limited (TBTL) projects.

## Details

The primary way to use this library is to construct an `X5Chain` struct using
the `Builder` struct. There is also `JwtX5Chain` for working with JWTs.

For additional documentation & examples, take a look at the [crate
documentation](https://docs.rs/bhx5chain).
